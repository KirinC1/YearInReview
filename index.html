            I learned a lot throughout this year. I have developed skills that I believe that I will use a lot in the future. Many 
            of these skills came from my classes at school, like this class, and even the core classes that I take at dtech.

            I was also able to do great things like present my team's game that we made at school, at Oracle OpenWorld in 2019.
